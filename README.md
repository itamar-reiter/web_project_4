**Tech**

Tech that were used: We used grid and flexbox displays for items-location, and media queries for the project's-resnposivity. We used BEM structure for organizing the files.
we used JavaScript functions such as addEventListener for managing the profile's name, the images etc.
everything organized at JS modules, and connected through 'index.js' file.
